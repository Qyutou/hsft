# HSFT - Haskell system fetch tool.
Simple and fast system fetch tool written in haskell.
Also it can show output of the shell commands,
it can be easily configured to show anything.

## Installation
It can be easily build manualy using cabal.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
$ git clone https://github.com/Qyutou/hsft
$ cd hsft
$ cabal install
```

To run the application, directory `.cabal/bin` must be in the $PATH,
or application can be installed to specified directory:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
$ cabal install --installdir=$HOME/bin
```

## Configuration
The configuration file is `app/Config.hs`.
Explanations of every field can be found in that file.

After changing configuration file you need to recompile the application:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
$ cabal install --overwrite-policy=always
```

The most important variable there is a `config`, 
which defines what information to show and in which order.
The values in this variable must be separated with spaces. 
All possible values are stored in the `fetchField` variable,
where you can see the value and the command which it will execute.
Value `"line"` adds a separator horizontal line.
```{haskell eval=FALSE}
config :: Data.Text.Text
config = "os kernel wm line terminal shell uptime"
```

In the `app/Config.hs` can be found an example of adding a field,
which based on the output from shell script.

Another variable important for customization is `colors`.
It must have all fields with colors for every element: 
borderColor, titleColor, separatorColor and infoColor.
To use default color (foreground color), the color field should be empty.
All other colors can be specified like `"red"`, `"green"`, `"brigthBlue"`, etc.
```{haskell eval=FALSE}
colors :: DataTypes.Colors
colors = DataTypes.Colors
  { borderColor = "blue"
  , titleColor = "yellow"
  , separatorColor = ""
  , infoColor = "white" }
```

## TODO
* [ ] Create better documentation.
* [ ] Add stack support.
* [ ] Add more fetch functions.
